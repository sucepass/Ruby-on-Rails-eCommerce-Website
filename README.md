# Special Thanks on 

[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly: THE TESTS FAIL (Because i didn't corrected them all loool! )

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

For more information, see the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](http://www.railstutorial.org/book).
